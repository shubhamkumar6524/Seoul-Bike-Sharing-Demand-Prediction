<p>Currently Many big cities have adopted the use of rental bikes to improve mobility comfort. It is crucial to make the rental bikes accessible and available to the general public at the appropriate time since it reduces waiting. Eventually, maintaining a steady supply of rental bikes for the city emerges as a top priority. Predicting how many bikes will be needed each hour to maintain a steady supply of rental bikes is essential.</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Description</h2>

<p>The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information</p>

**Date** : year-month-day

**Rented Bike count** : Count of bikes rented at each  hour

**Hour** : Hour of the day

**Temperature** : in Celsius

**Humidity** : %

**Wind Speed** : m/s

**Visibility** : 10m

**Dew point Temperature** :Celsius

**Solar_radiation** : MJ/m2

**Rainfall** : mm

**Seasons** : Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn ∙ Holiday - Holiday/No holiday 

**Functional Day** : NoFunc(Non Functional Hours),  Fun(Functional hours)

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Pipeline</h2>

● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I have performed EDA to understand the features to see the trend.

● Data Processing: I have went through each attributes and encoded the categorical features.

● Model Creation: Finally I've created various models. These models were created inorder to select the best possible model for this problem statement.

<h2> :clipboard: Future Work</h2>
<p> This project is helpful in the system's overall design, including the placement of bike-sharing stations, the size of the fleet, and the planning of investments. Other socioeconomic factors that may be taken into account in future work include population density, job density, retail job density, commute distance, reduction companies, tourist attractions, parks and recreation areas, topography, regional transit stations, bicycle-friendly streets, streets with bicycle lanes, and local transit stops. External parameters that have an impact on how often people ride bikes can be included to the model to further improve performance. Additionally, because of the study's scope, it can be applied to various forms of transportation </p>

<h2>:floppy_disk: Conclusion</h2>
<p>The overall number of bicycle rentals each month grows as the temperature rises, as can be seen. However, given that they are essentially consistent over the course of months, it appears that rentals are unaffected by the wind speed and humidity. This further supports both the strong association between rental rates and temperature as well as the idea that pleasant weather might be a reliable indicator. Therefore, people tend to rent bikes when the weather is great.
Planning for new bike rental facilities may require consideration of this.</p>
